                      Please note that this is still beta.
                  JA: Choice between Durham and Pythia scheme for pT definition in MLM matching

4.4.18 (19/03/09) JA: Improved speed of mssm, heft and sm production with variable scales

4.4.17 (27/02/09) JA: Fixed minor bugs introduced in v. 4.4.16:
                      Fixed bug with variable scales for incoming b-quarks when maxjetflavor<5
                      Fixed bug with PDFs for antiprotons
                      Fixed bug with variable scales with incoming none-QCD particles
                      Changed the cut ptheavy to be active only if there are heavy particles 
                        present

4.4.16 (11/02/09) JA: Multiple changes
                  - New treatment of PDFs by MadGraph. Now, only the PDFs for flavors actually used
                    are evaluated, since the PDF call previously took up to 50% of the time for
                    simple processes.
                  - New default scale choices: variable factorization and renormalization scales,
                    set to the central mT^2 scale after kT-clustering of the event.
                    For single heavy particle, this corresponds to the M^2+pT^2, for pair
                    of heavy particles it is the geometric mean of M^2+pT^2 for each particle,
                    for massless particles it is the pT^2 of the last pair after clustering.
                    If the last clustering is a t-channel colorless exchange (as, e.g., in WBF), 
                    the two fact. scales are set to the last mT^2 values on either side.
                  - These scales are overridden by scales defined in setscales.f, if they are 
                    returned as non-0.
                  - xqcut only acts on jet particles, as defined by maxjetflavor in the run_card
                  - The integration grid preparation takes into account xqcut, so no pT, deltaR 
                    or invariant mass cuts needed unless specifically wanted
		  - New, more reasonable, default for bwcutoff (15 instead of 5) in the run_card.

4.4.15 (30/01/09) MH: Fix bug in SM parameter convention for smckm model (Thanks to
                  Claude Duhr and Priscila de Aquino). Fix bug in ZH+H- coupling (compare to
                  AH+H-) in 2hdm and 2hdm_full, thanks to Heather Logan and Shain Davidson.

4.4.14 (23/01/09) JA & TS: Modifications of grid preconditioning
                  routines in myamp.f, to improve result for competing resonances.
                  Bug fixed affecting simulation of resonances in shat in the presence 
                  of competing resonances, e.g. pp>h>e+e-mu+mu-.

4.4.13 (12/01/09) FR Team: Changes motivated by the development of the MSSM FR Model.
		  Increase of default param values in params.inc for MG. Small bug correction
		  in original mssm interactions.dat file. Correction of particular HELAS routines 
		  jioc, jw3wn, jwwwn, w3w3n and wwwwn.

4.4.12 (27/12/08) MadTeam: Bug fixed: integration grids were not
                  systematically reset anymore since 4.3.0. This may have affected xsec
                  calculation and event generation starting from the second run in a given
                  process directory if particular cuts (pt,...) have been lowered in
                  run_card.dat after a first integration, or if the PDF/collider params have
                  been changed. In many cases, ME forced the grid reset, but not
                  systematically.

4.4.11 (09/12/08) RF: topBSM model upgrade and allow for both a prefix
		      and new color structure (06/10/08) for the same interaction

4.4.10 (25/11/08) PA: MadOnia implementation.

4.4.9 (17/11/08) RF: Fixed bug in color algebra for the MadDipole package.
                     Thanks to Axel Bredenstein for pointing this out.

4.4.8 (11/11/08) OM: modification in Template for compatibility with MadWeight 2.1.5. 
		     (See MadWeight Updates Notes for more details). 
		     The only file modified is cuts.f (change some comment line)
		     
4.4.7 (10/10/08) OM+MH: Correct major bug (in refine) introduce in version 4.4.5
                 thanks to Neil and Claude
                  
4.4.6 (06/10/08) TS: more general color structure, a user can add a 3 octet interaction 
                 with the d^abc color structure using the line
                 g g g G  QCD ^dabc^
                 in interactions.dat

4.4.5 (30/09/08) OM: Full compatibility of ME with gfortran.
		 OM: MadWeight is running and has now is own version number/Updates notes. Major modification of MW 
		     will be notify here anyway.

4.4.4 (22/09/08) MH: Corrected small bug with spin states in qnumbers. Tks to Mario Kadastik

4.4.3 (08/08/08) RF: Added MadDipole functionality for automated dipole
		 subtraction. StandAlone version only.
                 See the wiki-page for more details.

4.4.2 (4/08/08) OM+PA: 
	       -> MadWeight doesn't work completly 
	       -> MadWeight reads particles.dat for full model compatibility
	       -> include madweight specific card via a automatic generation of .inc file 

4.4.1 (15/07/08) OM+PA: First step of the merge: MadWeight only
	       -> MadGraph 4.3.0 : stable
	       -> MadWeight : not working

4.4.0 (??/??/??) JA: Added new notation to remove diagams with given s-channel
                     propagators in for process generation.
                     Ex:  pp > bb~W+W- $ t
                     to remove all diagrams with t as s-channel propagator 
                     (in order to get only single top with extra b)

-- Passing to subversion 4.4  with MadWeight+MadDipole+Madonia functionality --

4.3.0 (08/07/08) MG Team: Added functionality for generating and running 
                 processes for the Grid. By setting the option gridpack
                 to .true. in run_card.dat, an enhanced survey will be
                 performed, and a file gridpack.tar.gz will be created.
                 This file can then be sent to the Grid for optimized
                 event generation on single-processor machines. Please see
                 http://cp3wks05.fynu.ucl.ac.be/twiki/bin/view/Library/GridDevelopment
                 for additional instructions.
                 MG Team: Added large set of extra parameters and cuts 
                 in run_card.dat:
                 gridpack: (see above)
                 bwcutoff: How many width away from the pole mass a 
                    resonance is included in the event file. Especially
                    important for decay chain processes, where the Breit
                    Wigner of specified resonances is cutoff at this value
                 maxjetflavor: How many quark flavors are affected by the
                    jet cuts, i.e. are seen as massless quarks
                 missing ET cuts
                 maximum pt, invariant mass and delta R cuts
                 minimum rapidity cuts
                 specified pt cuts for each of the first four jets
                 HT cuts (total jet HT and 2,3,4 jet HT)

-- Passing to subversion 4.3 with grid functionality --

4.2.11 (09/06/08) JA: Allow for process specific parameters in the run_card,
                  using the syntax value = param@PID where PID is the process
                  id set in the proc_card.dat.

4.2.10 (30/05/08) RF: Added the spin-2 routines by Hagiwara et al.
                  (0805.2554 [hep-ph]). These routines should still be used
                  with care, in particular because the 5-point interactions
                  are not yet there in a way that they can be automatized.

4.2.9 (15/05/08) JA: Allow for arbitrary integer N in process flag @N in
                 MG proc_card.dat 

4.2.8 (09/05/08) TS: Fixed problem with phase space sampling in the process
                 pp>bb~ by making analytical transformation of shat.
                 JA: Fixed issue with ixxxxx.F for negative-mass initial state
                 particles in decay processes A>BC.
                 JA: Fixed sign of widths of Majorana fermions in mssm (need
                 to be same as sign of mass for HELAS)

4.2.7 (16/04/08) TS: Bug in tops.f afflicting certain decay chain processes 
                 fixed. Thanks to Roberto Franceschini.

4.2.6 (20/02/08) JA: Bug in readproc.f affecting certain decay processes 
                 A>BC fixed. Max number of multiparticle labels changed to 10.

4.2.5 (12/02/08) TS: correct error in format statement in scale_events.f 
                 for cases w/ B.W. and > 100 diagrams. Thanks to Erkcan Ozcan.
                 TS: Take into account color factor when grouping diagram. 
                 Thanks to Roberto Franceschini for pointing out this
                 possible issue.

4.2.4 (27/01/08) MH: New (faster) version of merge.pl by Richard Corke
                 JA: Changed ren and fact scales in matched ktjet case
		 when last clustering is QCD s-channel to m_T.
		 Improved ordering of channels in the batch job files to 
		 make run time more equal for the different jobs.

4.2.3 (14/01/08) JA: Fixed initial random seed to work with bash scripts
                 Fixed bug with w mass in MSSM model, introduced in v4.1.47

4.2.2 (21/12/07) JA: MG/ME completely moved from csh to bash. Modified files:
		 MadGraphII/readproc.f
		 Template/Source/gen_ximprove.f
		 Template/SubProcesses/symmetry.f
		 Template/bin: calculate_crossx clean gen_crossxhtml-pl 
		    generate_events monitor multi_run newprocess 
		    newprocess_sa plot put_banner qsub refine remove rmrun 
		    run_combine standalone store sumall survey 

4.2.1 (15/12/07) MH: Fix PDG mass of antitau in DECAY. Thanks to A. Strumia !

4.2.0 (12/12/07) JA/TS: Included support for decay chains.
                 Added support for 10 external particles.
                 Changed files:
                 MadGraphII: colors.f crossing.f driver.f fields.f readproc.f
                 sort.f tops.f write_configs.f params.inc
                 Template/SubProcesses: cuts.f myamp.f symmetry.f  genps.inc
                 Template/Source: genps.inc
                 Template/bin: newprocess
                 Usage example: Specify decay using the syntax 
                    ab > (c>(d>ef)g) (h>ij) k
                 meaning that ab > chk is the central process and c and h decay
                 further. Note that decayed particles are forced to be on the 
                 Breit Wigner (Mass +/- 5 Gamma).
                 JA: Fixed formatting bug in LHE files in case of 10 process 
                 numbers

-- Passing to subversion 4.2 with the inclusion of the decay chain formalism --

4.1.47 (08/12/07) JA: Moved card info into <header> of LHE file using XML 
                  tags.
		  JA: Fixed bug in downloaded version, introduced with 
		  v. 4.1.45 (thanks to Bob McElrath!)

4.1.46 (26/11/07) RF: For the on-line plotting, MadAnalysis now used.

4.1.45 (07/11/07) JA: Added possibility to specify decay processes to
                  MadGraph and MadEvent, such as ta+>e+vevt~, instead of
		  the normal scattering processes.
		  In this case, none of the information in the run_card.dat
		  is used. The scale for alpha_s is the mass of the decaying 
		  particle.
                  TS: Fixed bug in MadGraph when required s-channel
                  propagator is a Majorana fermion

4.1.44 (27/10/07) JA: Fixed so MadGraph writes abs(masses) in phase
                  space also for internal propagators (since SUSY can have 
		  negative masses)
		  JA: Fixed grid PDF preparation in gensym when s-channel 
		  propagator has mass < min energy of final-states

4.1.43 (16/10/07) MH: Moved QNUMBERS definition to usrmod framework
                  JA: Added automatic running of hep2lhe conversion and
		  root file generation in run_pythia and run_pgs scripts
		  Added extra store call in generate_events to store
		  generation before start of Pythia and PGS runs
		  Added cut on energy of jets, b, lepton, photon
		  JA: Removed "wait" statement in newprocess which gave 
		  problems for process generation on certain Linux systems

4.1.42 (01/10/07) JA: Added the promised buttons to run Pythia and PGS 
                  directly from the crossx page
		  Added automatic LHE converstion of Pythia file in
		  generate_events
		  Write error message for 0 cross section

4.1.41 (12/09/07) JA: Fixed bug in genps.f which sometimes gave
                  segmentation fault for complicated processes 
                  JA: Different process ids in the event file for the
                  different process group numbers specified in the
                  proc_card.dat

4.1.40 (06/09/07) JA: Added possibility to specify beam polarization
                  (between -100, completely left-handed, and 100,
                  completely right-handed, with 0 meaning unpolarized
                  beam) in run_card.dat

4.1.39 (30/08/07) RF: Added optional parameter fixed_couplings to run_card.dat
		  to calculate coupling 'constants' for every event. Also
		  included a common block for the momenta so that they are
		  available in couplings.f.
		  Added a partial set of HELAS routines for the spin-2 (graviton)

4.1.38 (27/08/07) MH: Added support for QNUMBERS (qnumbers.pl script to add
                  info from particles.dat in the param_card section of the banner)
                  for future compatibiliy with external generic decay routines
                  (Les Houches 07 project)

4.1.37 (22/08/07) MH: Changed default behavior if no PDF (0 and 0). Now
                  the alpha_s value is extracted from the G value computed from
                  the param_card and is no longer extracted from the PDF quoted 
                  in the run_card. The default order for the running of alfas is 2.
                  MH: Fixed conflict between same name routines open_file
                  now the MODEL routine is called open_file_mdl
                  MH: Remove unnecessary open_file.f in usrmod v1

4.1.36 (13/08/07) JA: Fixed bug for identical particles in color structure 
                  by diagram

4.1.35 (10/08/07) TS: Major improvements to generation efficiency.
                  Get exact number of events asked for
                  JA: Choose color structure by diagram, which allows
                  better sampling of very subleading color structures.
                  Improved treatment of propagator inclusion in event 
                  files.
		  OM: Fixed bug in photon flux function, introduced 
                  with v. 4.1.32

4.1.34 (03/08/07) JA: Set couplings event-by-event for variable
                  scales, to get right scale also for SUSY couplings
                  SdV: Added WBF delta(eta) cut to run_card

4.1.33 (27/06/07) JA: Addition to dsample.f to facilitate event
                  combination when no events pass cuts in one channel

4.1.32 (11/06/07) OM: Change for Matrix Element project: add an option
                  to change the name of the read param_card.dat. 
		  Modification in Models and in Template.

-- the main branch                                                         --

4.0.18 (3/1/07) MH: Modify makefiles to make TDPLOTS correctly. Remove the old
       source files in Source. Remove "-d" tag in pbs call for pythia and pgs.
       Run combine_event on a node.

4.0.17 (3/1/07) Added TDPLOTS in the main directory. This new version
       allows to produce topdrawer plots from lhe and lhco event files.
       There is also a script for combining plots together.  

4.0.16 (2/1/07) Removed bugfix in Zoom_Event in Template/SubProcesses/unwgt.f
       since it gave bad results in second run

4.0.15 (19/12/06) Pythia and PGS run on the cluster if requested, solve a bug
       in deleting jobs, correct cards for ATLAS and CMS for PGS

4.0.14 (18/12/06) Check in MadGraph for different final state masses
       in multiple processes also for scalars

4.0.9  (1/12/06) FM: Allowed negative values for the cuts
       (etmin,etamax,deltaR,s_min). If a value is negative, the
       request is inverted. So etmin(j)=-30 means et(j)<30 and so on.
       myamp.f modified accordingly so that if one of the cuts is
       negative, it it treated as a zero. Files touched:
       SubProcesses/setcuts.f SubProcesses/cuts.f SubProcesses/myamp.f
